## Project Description: Enhancing Business Growth through Data Optimization

### 1. Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a prominent medium-sized organization specializing in bikes and cycling accessories, has partnered with Tony Smith, a distinguished member of KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team. The collaboration aims to leverage KPMG's Analytics, Information & Modelling expertise to enhance Sprocket Central's business growth.


### 2. Project Overview
Sprocket Central is seeking assistance in optimizing its marketing strategy by effectively analyzing its customer and transaction data. The organization possesses a substantial dataset related to its customers but is currently facing challenges in extracting meaningful insights. To address this, KPMG will embark on a comprehensive data exploration initiative to identify opportunities for improvement and ensure the dataset's quality aligns with the business growth objectives.

#### Benefits:
- Enhanced understanding of customer behavior.
- Improved data quality for informed decision-making.
- Optimized marketing strategy for increased business growth.

#### Tools:
- Excel
- Tableau

## Data Quality Assessment
In this phase, the three datasets provided were assessed based on the seven dimensions (i.e., Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Currency, Relevancy, Validity, and Uniqueness) of data quality assessments. The following results were obtained:
- More customer_ids record in the Transactions table and Customer Address table but fewer in Customer Demographic (and this will be the Master Table).
- Missing values: columns such as brand of a purchase, job title have empty values in certain records.
- Inconsistency in records for similar attributes like in the Customer Demographic table (e.g., gender: as M, F, Female, and Male, while state field as Victoria is represented as V, Vic, and Victoria).
- Inconsistent data type for similar attributes like numeric values for some fields and string for others. These quality assessments were done with the use of Excel, cleaned, standardized, and transformed as needed in preparation for the next phase.

## Data Insights: Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Uncovering Trends in the Underlying Data
The analysis set out to identify trends within the data, allowing us to discern patterns and fluctuations crucial for adapting marketing strategies to dynamic market conditions.

### 2. Determining the Highest-Value Customer Segment
Through a comprehensive Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, we sought to understand the customer profile deeply. This involved evaluating the recency of customer interactions, the frequency of purchases, and the monetary value of transactions to identify and prioritize the highest-value customer segment.

### 3. Crafting a Strategic Marketing and Growth Plan
The overarching goal of the analysis was to propose a tailored marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. By delving into customer behavior, preferences, and product choices, we aimed to provide actionable insights to steer the company's growth trajectory.

### 4. Profiling Customers Across Age Groups
The exploration involved segmenting customers based on age groups to gain a nuanced understanding of their preferences and behaviors. This segmentation allows for targeted marketing efforts, ensuring that strategies resonate effectively with each age cohort.

### 5. Assessing Product Choice Over Time
A thorough examination of product choices made by customers over the 12-month observation period was conducted. This temporal analysis helps in identifying product preferences and adapting inventory and marketing strategies accordingly.

### 6. Evaluating Sprockets Product Performance Across Industries
The analysis extended to evaluating how Sprockets products performed among customers in various industries. This insight aids in tailoring product offerings and marketing approaches to better align with industry-specific needs.

### 7. Exploring Location-Wise Customer Profiles
To enhance geographic targeting, the analysis delved into the location-wise distribution of customer profiles. Understanding the geographic concentration of customers assists in refining marketing strategies and optimizing resource allocation in specific regions.
